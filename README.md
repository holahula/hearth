# Hearth

There are thousands of youth with access to SMS who need food and or a place to stay. Tons of perfectly good food is wasted every day after restaurants, stores and bakeries close. We shouldn't have to wait for drastic legislative changes to fix this: https://www.change.org/p/parliament-end-food-waste-in-canada


On one side, Hearth provides an SMS service for those who need food or a place to stay, and sends directions to nearest food or shelter resource without needing data/wifi. On the other side, it provides an easy way for restaurants/stores/bakeries to share extra food at the end of the day that would otherwise be wasted.
